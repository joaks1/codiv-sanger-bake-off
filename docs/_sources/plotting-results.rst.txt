Plotting the simulation results
###############################

After simulating datasets and analyzing those datasets, you might be interested
in looking at some plots that summarize the results of those thousands of
analyses.
To do so, navigate to the ``scripts`` directory of the project::

    cd /path/to/your/copy/of/codiv-sanger-bake-off/scripts

and activate the Python virtual environment for the project::

    source ../pyenv/bin/activate

Then, run the ``plot_sim_results.py`` script::

    python plot_sim_results.py

The plots generated by this script will be written to the
``codiv-sanger-bake-off/results/plots`` directory, which from inside the
``scripts`` directory is located at ``../results/plots``.

All of the plots are written as PDF files, and so can be viewed with any PDF
viewer.

.. note:: If the plotting script worked, you can ignore this. If it didn't,
    please continue reading...

    The plotting script requires the ``matplotlib`` package, which requires the
    ``NumPy`` package.
    These requirements were installed to the Python virtual environment when we
    set up the project, so in theory, the plotting script should just work.
    However, the distributions of the ``matplotlib`` and ``NumPy`` packages are
    "brittle," and will sometimes fail to work "out-of-the-box" on some systems.
    If the plotting script failed for you, it is likely due to this issue.
    The brittleness of ``matplotlib``/``NumPy`` is often caused by the
    pre-compiled packages having dynamic links to external libraries.
    I have seen this with the distributions from both PyPI/``pip`` (what we are
    using) and ``conda``.
