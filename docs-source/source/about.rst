About
#####

This is a project by the |phyleticalab|_ to compare approximate and
full-likelihood Bayesian approaches to estimating shared divergence times
across multiple taxa.
This page documents this project for two purposes:

1. To aid members of the |phyleticalab|_ in working on this project
   collaboratively.
2. To allow anyone to follow along with the project who might be interested in
   reproducing our findings or learning how to practice open science and/or use
   tools for comparative phylogeographic inference, such as |eco|_.

The goal of this documentation is to convey the goals and workflow of the
project.
The ultimate arbiter of the full history and details of the project is the
|project_repo|_.
